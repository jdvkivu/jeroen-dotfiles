# First use
Checkout or download this project to any location in your computer.

There are 3 main bootstrapping scripts:
- `osx-defaults.sh` this script will set preferences of your Mac
- `brew.sh` will install Homebrew and the applications listed in it
- `bootstrap.sh` will create symlinks to all terminal configuration files in this project

Review these files and run them one by one in this order. You should have reasonable defaults and applications now.
